# Crime-Data-Analysis
This is my first Data Analysis project . It was great time to build a project and was exciting . It's an Crime Data Analysis  which involves systematically examining crime-related data to identify patterns, trends, and potential risks, ultimately informing crime prevention and resource allocation strategies for law enforcement.
